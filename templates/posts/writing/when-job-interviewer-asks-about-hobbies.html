<h3>Instruction</h3>

<h3>Reading(25 min)</h3>

<p>Read <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/when-job-interviewer-asks-about-hobbies-2016-1">What hiring managers really want to know when they ask, 'What are your hobbies?'</a>. Do not hesitate to use a dictionary. Do not rush. If you cannot read it in 25 minutes, that's OK. It's better to understand a few paragraphs completely than to understand the whole article only vaguely. If you finish reading it, keep reading the rest of the article and even the responses.</p>


<p>Answer the following questions as you read.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Identify the subject(主語) and the verb(動詞) of each clause(節).</li>
	<li>For each article(冠詞) or lack of thereof, think about why.</li>
</ul>


<p>Whenever you have trouble understanding a sentence or part of a sentence, ask me.</p>



<h3>Short lecture(5 min)</h3>

<p>I will go over the sentences, phrases, or words that many of you had trouble with. I will also touch on more advanced grammar appeared in the article that I did not cover in English Seminar 2-7.</p>


<h3>Writing(40 min)</h3>

<p>Answer the following questions. If you don't have time, you don't have to answer all of them. Please type it in a word processor.</p>

<ol>
<li>
	Which section(s) was the most helpful? Why?
</li>
<li>
	Which section(s), if any, do you disagree with? Why?
</li>
<li>
	Answer the question 'What are your hobbies?' as if you were at a job interview. Make sure you meet all the 9 points in the article(unless you disagree with some of them). Since this is writing and not conversation, you can't just say a few words and wait for a manager to ask you a question. Think about what follow up questions the maneger would ask and address them in your writing. 
</li>
<li>Write general comments about the article.</li>

</ol>

<h3>Feedback and Correction(15 min)</h3>

<p>I will give feedback and correct grammatical mistakes on your writing.</p>

<p>Email your work to <strong>kenzotakahashi2@gmail.com</strong> . I will compile all of your work and share it with you so that you can read your classmates' work. If you don't want to share a particular answer, write <strong>(private)</strong> at the beginning of the answer. But please share as many of them as possible.</p>
