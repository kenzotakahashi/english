<h3>Instruction</h3>

<h3>Watching & Reading(25 min)</h3>

<p>We will watch <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/regina_hartley_why_the_best_hire_might_not_have_the_perfect_resume?language=en">Why the best hire might not have the perfect resume</a> together. After watching, you have more time to rewatch the video or read the transcript on your own. Do not hesitate to use a dictionary. Do not rush. If you cannot read it in 25 minutes, that's OK. It's better to understand a few paragraphs completely than to understand the whole article only vaguely.</p>

<p>Answer the following questions as you read.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Identify the subject(主語) and the verb(動詞) of each clause(節).</li>
	<li>For each article(冠詞) or lack of thereof, think about why.</li>
</ul>


<p>Whenever you have trouble understanding a sentence or part of a sentence, ask me.</p>



<h3>Short lecture(5 min)</h3>

<p>I will go over the sentences, phrases, or words that many of you had trouble with. I will also touch on more advanced grammar appeared in the article that I did not cover in English Seminar 2-7.</p>


<h3>Writing(40 min)</h3>

<p>Answer the following questions. If you don't have time, you don't have to answer all of them. Please type it in a word processor.</p>

<ol>
<li>
	Summarise the talk in one or two sentences.
</li>
<li>
	Do you have some experiences that might not look good on resume?
</li>
<li>
	Describe what "Scrapper" is.
</li>

</li>

	Write general comments about the article.
</li>
</ol>

<h3>Feedback and Correction(15 min)</h3>

<p>I will give feedback and correct grammatical mistakes on your writing.</p>

<p>Email your work to <strong>kenzotakahashi2@gmail.com</strong> . I will compile all of your work and share it with you so that you can read your classmates' work. If you don't want to share a particular answer, write <strong>(private)</strong> at the beginning of the answer. But please share as many of them as possible.</p>
