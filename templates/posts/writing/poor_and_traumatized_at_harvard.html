<h3>Instruction</h3>

<h3>Reading(25 min)</h3>

<p>Read the first 9 paragraphs of <a href="https://medium.com/@duequach/poor-and-traumatized-at-harvard-e5938b702207#.ann48836x">Poor and Traumatized at Harvard</a>(the last paragraph ends with "I didn't want anyone to know I was falling apart."). There are many difficult words in this article, so do not hesitate to use a dictionary. Do not rush. If you cannot read it in 25 minutes, that's OK. It's better to understand a few paragraphs completely than to understand the whole article only vaguely. If you finish reading it, keep reading the rest of the article and even the responses.</p>

<p>As far as I know, there are 19 adjective clauses(形容詞節) and 8 noun clauses(名詞節) in the article. That is a lot. If you don't understand them, it will be really tough to read.</p>

<p>Answer the following questions as you read.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Identify the subject(主語) and the verb(動詞) of each clause(節).</li>
	<li>For each article(冠詞) or lack of thereof, think about why.</li>
</ul>
